## Getting Started 🚀

1. **Clone This Masterpiece**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mvstermind/note-keeper.git
   cd note-keeper
   ```

2. **Compile the Magic**:

   Wave your wand (or just type):

   ```bash
   make
   ```

   Voilà! You’ve just turned `main.c` into an executable named `main`. You’re basically a wizard now! 🧙‍♂️

3. **Unleash the Beast**:

   ```bash
   ./main [flags] [arguments]
   ```

   Now you’re in the driver’s seat! Buckle up and enjoy the ride.

## How to Play 🎮

**Note Keepa** isn’t just any old note-keeping app—it’s your personal digital notepad that lives in the terminal. Here's how to have fun with it:

### Add a Note 🖋️

Got something on your mind? Spill the beans with the `-a` flag:

```bash
./main -a "Don't forget to buy a llama!"
```

Your note will be safely tucked away in `notes.txt`, never to be forgotten (unless you clear it...).

### Wipe Everything 🧼

Had enough of your notes? Ready to start fresh? Nuke ‘em all with:

```bash
./main -c
```

Your `notes.txt` will be cleaner than a whistle, my friend. ✨

### Spy on Your Notes 🕵️‍♂️

Peek at all those deep thoughts you’ve saved by using the `-v` flag:

```bash
./main -v
```

Your notes will appear in a fancy-schmancy frame, right in the middle of your screen. Who says terminals can't be stylish? 💅

### Help! 🆘

Lost in the sauce? No worries! Just call for help with:

```bash
./main -h
```

It’ll give you the lowdown on how to use this crazy thing.
